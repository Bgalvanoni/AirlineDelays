<h1> What makes an Airline better from the rest? Carrier Delays on Domestic Flights tell us the answer. 
 </h1>
	<p class="byline"> Ben Galvanoni <br> Galvanoni Times Journalist</p>

<div class= "story-copy">
	<p>Over 350 million people have flown domestically in 2022. The United States continues to be dominated by air travel for getting from point A to point B. 
</p>
	<p>However, not all airports–or airlines–are perfect in getting their passengers to a destination on time. Airlines are businesses that are driven to create a profit for its shareholders. But some are operated differently than others. 
</p>
<p>For the past century, countless airlines have graced the skies and dominated the industry. But since the United States deregulated air-travel in 1978, four primary carriers have emerged to dominate the market. United Airlines, American, Delta, and Southwest control almost 65% of the domestic market for air travel. All four have unique operating structures, fly a variety of routes, and have different hubs scattered across the country. But the airlines all have one thing in common: delays. 
</p>
<p>20% of all flights get delayed by at least 15 minutes. It is a traveling issue that everyone has faced. But would it help to know what airlines have the most delays? </p>
<p>The majority of flights are not delayed by regulatory groups–like air-traffic control–but by the airlines themselves. “We don’t cancel flights as air traffic controllers.  It’s up to the company to cancel their flights,” said Syracuse Airport Tower Specialist Jeremy Hendershot.  “As ATC, we are here to offer a service to separate and expedite the flow of aircraft.”
</p>
<p>Delays can arise from various issues such as weather, mechanical issues, or heavy traffic flow at the airport. But it comes down to the airline on deciding whether to delay flights. 
</p>
<p>Air Travel is so rapid and immense, delays are inevitable with so many flights and only a limited number of gates. Airlines try to use hubs to ease the flow of travel in larger airports with more gates to counteract the daily flow of passengers. 
</p>

</script>
<p>Using a smaller sample size with the highest level of traffic will demonstrate how efficient each airline is. Smaller airports that feed into larger hubs also feel the impact of the high traffic levels airlines deal with. A prime example of this is Syracuse Hancock airport.
</p>

<p> “Delta, American and United fly a lot to big feeder airports like JFK, Atlanta and Charlotte, so they’re impacted by the congestion delays and subjected to release times from Syracuse,” Hendershot says. “All in all, the delays are evenly split throughout the air carriers we have here.”
</p>

</script>

<p>Weather is another critical factor that causes delays and is responsible for the majority of flight cancellations. This is apparent in flights to airports that have more frequent weather issues; and airlines that fly there are subject to those delays. “One way to answer that part of the question is examining where different companies fly to.  JetBlue and Allegiant fly a lot to Florida, so they don’t see delays from congestion as much as weather,” said Hendershot.

<ul> O'Hare Airport in Chicago is home to all four major airline carriers.
</ul>
</div>

<p>Looking at these four carriers, each one essentially flies to almost every airport in the country. This levels the playing field in regards to dealing with weather and focuses more on the functionality of their delays. 
</p>
<p>Airlines use a combination of factors to choose whether to delay a flight. Prime examples include maintenance on an aircraft, crew problems, or baggage loading. It can be an issue that also stems from airport personnel; affecting the airline’s efficiency.
</p>

<p>Especially during holiday seasons, travelers want to have a reliable way of getting from point A to point B. Airline customers usually are divided into two categories and priced differently. Business travelers will pay more for tickets that provide more flexibility on flights. Meanwhile, leisure travelers usually pay less for a ticket that gives no flexibility in date or time changes. Delays will hurt these types of travelers the most, given that it inconveniences the ticket holder with no flexibility.  
</p>
<p>In today’s airline economy, loyalty runs the industry. Customers will make sure to book their flight on their favorite carrier that they believe provides the best service. </p>
<p>The four major carriers analyzed expand their consumer reach beyond the terminal and runway. Each airline has their own personalized, reward system that awards loyalty through flight miles.</p>
<p>Feeling rewarded can make any customer feel wanted and provide more business to the carrier, regardless of service. The FAA’s database that was used in this research is used to find the frequency of delays by airlines.</p>
<p>American Airlines has the most flights flown in 2022, while also delaying the most flights. But that does not ensure American is the most unreliable airline on the market. If you look into why carriers delay flights, Delta Airlines has over 49% of all departures delayed due to carrier issues.  
</p>
<p>Airlines have so many delays that are out of their control. It is the part of the business that is inevitable. But being considerate to the efficiency of each airline helps the consumer know who to trust next travel season.
